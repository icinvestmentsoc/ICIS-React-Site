          <p class="lead"> No financial contribution is required to participate as a research analyst or to vote for
            investment ideas. However, Investment Society members and research analysts will be
            offered the opportunity to purchase a limited number of shares in Queen’s Tower Capital.
            The proceeds from the shares buy in will go towards growing the fund. </p>
          <p class="lead">80% of the fund will be invested in equities (long-only), bonds and other standard
            instruments available through our broker (IG). Most research analysts will contribute to
            growing this portion of the fund led by <strong> Oscar Wooding, Chief Investment Officer</strong>. </p>

         <p class="lead">10% will be used in systematic investing strategies. Those keen to code can join our
            systematic investing team led by <strong>Brendan Patalong, Investment Officer</strong>. </p>
        <p class="lead">10% will be invested in cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency analysts will be able to join the
            fund’s cryptocurrency investing team led by <strong>Sean Yu, Investment Officer </strong>.</p>
        <p class="lead">The fund will be rebalanced to these percentages at the end of each term.</p>

        ideas per term</strong>. During non-pitching weeks, main fund analysts will be asked to produce a
        brief report on the main market moves in their sector for that week which may be featured
        in the Investment column of Felix. </p>
        <p class="lead"> For systematic and cryptocurrency analysts, the structure will be slightly different. The
        relevant investment officer will be in touch throughout the term with alpha-generating and
        support projects for you to work on. </p>
        <p class="lead">All analysts are expected to attend the <strong> 1 hour pitching sessions </strong> (6pm Tuesday, Huxley 308).
        Along with general Investment Society members, you will be able to hear the pitches of
        other analysts and vote for the ones you think should be invested in the fund.</p>
