          <p class="lead"> Queen’s Tower Capital is the undergraduate student run investment fund under Imperial
            College Investment Society. The fund is designed to give students a taster of the world of
            institutional investing. Led by the investment officers, the fund’s research analysts will pitch
            their best investment ideas on a weekly basis (@ Tuesday 6pm, Huxley 308) alongside our
            bi-weekly investment cycles. Research analysts will be able to develop both analytical and
            communication skills throughout the process of researching a stock and pitching it to
            members of the Investment Society. </p>

            <p class="lead">The fund’s objective is clear cut: we seek to generate superior risk-adjusted returns via
            ethical and sustainable investments backed by systematic and rigorous research. We aim to be
            adventurous whilst keeping a strict tally on our risk exposure, and to this end the systematic
            and cryptocurrency sub-funds are a valuable addition this year.</p>
            <p class="lead">We include all members of the Investment Society in the decision-making process via
            democratic voting to encourage all members to tune in and develop a deep knowledge of
            the assets being pitched. Lessons learned through participation in Queen’s Tower Capital
            will be useful for career and for life.</p>
